# DataBriefing IPython notebooks

These are example notebooks for articles on
[https://www.databriefing.com/coding/](https://www.databriefing.com/coding/).

If you're using the DataBriefing Vagrant VM and follow the suggested
directory structure you should clone this repo inside
`databriefing-vm/shared/src` so your directory tree becomes
`databriefing-vm/shared/src/article-notebooks`.

If you use a different structure don't forget to edit the path you load
your data from in the example notebooks.
